Python is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamic programming language that has many differences from C and C++. Here are some of the main aspects of how Python compiles code and works internally compared to those languages:

- **Compilation**: Python does not compile its code into machine code, something that hardware can understand. Instead, it compiles it into something called byte code, which is an intermediate representation of the source code. Byte code is stored in .pyc or .pyo files that are generated when a Python module is imported for the first time. Byte code can be executed by a virtual machine, but not by the CPU directly. C and C++, on the other hand, compile their code into machine code that can be executed by the CPU without any intermediate step.
- **Interpretation**: Python uses an interpreter called the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) to execute the byte code. The PVM is a software layer that reads each byte code instruction and performs the corresponding operation. The PVM also handles memory management, exception handling, and other features of the language. The PVM is platform-independent, meaning that the same byte code can run on different operating systems and architectures. C and C++ do not use an interpreter, but rely on the operating system and the hardware to execute their machine code.
- **Typing**: Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. Python does not require explicit type declarations or type checking before running the code. This makes Python more flexible and expressive, but also more prone to runtime errors and performance issues. C and C++ are statically typed languages, meaning that the type of a variable is declared at compile time and checked before running the code. This makes C and C++ more strict and efficient, but also more verbose and rigid.
- **Memory management**: Python uses automatic memory management, meaning that it allocates and deallocates memory for objects as needed without requiring explicit instructions from the programmer. Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of how many references an object has, and frees it when there are no more references to it. Python also uses a mechanism called garbage collection to detect and collect objects that are no longer reachable, even if they still have references to them. This prevents memory leaks and simplifies programming, but also adds some overhead and unpredictability. C and C++ use manual memory management, meaning that the programmer has to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for objects using functions such as malloc() and free(). This gives more control and performance to the programmer, but also introduces more complexity and risks of memory errors.

These are some of the main differences between how Python compiles code and works internally compared to C and C++. Of course, there are many more details and nuances that can be learned. Here are some links that delve deeper.
